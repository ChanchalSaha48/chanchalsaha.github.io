          <p>
            I am currently working on deep learning and natural language processing applications in the 
            healthcare domain. My ongoing work includes cancer image classification tasks such as brain 
            cancer MRI, lung and colon cancer classification, and breast cancer histopathology analysis 
            using transfer learning and fine-tuning (ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, VGG). These projects aim 
            to improve diagnostic accuracy under small-data constraints by leveraging domain-specific 
            augmentation and interpretable CNN architectures.
          </p>

          <p>
            In parallel, I am working on NLP-based mental health analysis using classical ML models 
            (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) and deep learning (LSTM). This work focuses 
            on understanding emotional and psychological patterns in text data and developing early-stage 
            digital mental-health risk detection tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            My future direction is shifting toward transformer-based models and Large Language Models (LLMs) 
            for clinical text understanding, medical report summarization, and explainable medical reasoning. 
            I plan to explore BERT, RoBERTa, and domain-specific transformer architectures, with the goal of 
            integrating them into practical healthcare AI systems. My Master’s thesis will focus on LLM-based 
            frameworks for intelligent, interpretable, and domain-specific medical decision support.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the long term, I aim to bridge CNN-based medical imaging pipelines with LLM-driven textual 
            reasoning to create unified multimodal diagnostic systems capable of combining visual and textual 
            clinical information.
